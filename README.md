# Micromouse Maze Game

A hardware-based maze navigation game implemented on the **DE1-SoC (Cyclone V) FPGA** using **Verilog HDL**.  
The design uses FSM-driven control, PS/2 input decoding, VGA rendering, on-chip memory, audio playback, and a hardware countdown timer.

## Features

- Tile-based 2D maze at **640×480 @ 60Hz**
- Single-player and multiplayer modes
- PS/2 keyboard input (arrow keys + WASD)
- Power-up tiles for speed-boost movement
- Movement-triggered PCM audio playback
- **60-second hardware timer** displayed on VGA and HEX
- On-screen progress bar
- Modular, multi-FSM architecture

## Technical Details

- Developed in **Intel Quartus Prime** using **Verilog HDL**
- Simulated in **ModelSim** (behavioral + timing)
- Dual-FSM structure: Game FSM + Player FSM
- Maze stored in **M10K on-chip memory** (25×25 grid)
- VGA controller generates full timing and pixel output
- PS/2 interface decodes make/break scancodes
- Audio system uses PCM samples stored in M10K ROM
- Synchronization implemented using flip-flops and clock division
- Memory usage optimized to support VGA + audio concurrently

### Game FSM
- Manages global screens: `START → PLAY → WIN/TIMEOUT → RESET`
- Controls `enable_player` gating and synchronizes all subsystems  
- Reads `move_pulse` + win state from Player FSM

### Player FSM
- Reads PS/2 scancodes  
- Implements movement, collision detection, tile validation  
- Handles power-up–enabled 2-tile jumps with safe-boundary checks  
- Outputs: `move_pulse`, `player_x`, `player_y`, `player_win`

### Maze Generator
- Hardware-generated 25×25 maze grid  
- Flattened **625-bit register** for single-cycle access  
- Deterministic “snake-path” topology with branches

### VGA Pipeline
- Generates all VGA timing signals (HS/VS, pixel clock)  
- Priority rendering: **Text → Player → Maze → Background**  
- Uses PLL-derived 25MHz pixel clock for stable display  

### Audio Engine
- PCM samples stored in **M10K blocks**  
- Playback triggered on `move_pulse`  
- Memory reduced/optimized to fit alongside VGA tile RAM

## ModelSim Simulation

ModelSim testbenches were used to validate:

- Player FSM transition logic  
- Debounce logic for PS/2 movement  
- Collision + boundary handling  
- Speed-boost (2-tile) movement behavior  
- Game FSM response to `player_win` and timer expiry  
- VGA timing signal correctness (HS/VS generation)  

Waveform analysis was used to verify:

- Flip-flop timing
- Synchronization between modules
- Edge-detect logic
- Memory read/write timing relative to VGA scan
